# Library-App
Got frustrated with never knowing when new books were out for series/by authors I enjoyed, thought I could try change it...
Well, that's what this is about.

It should connect with some online API, get information about books, series, etc, and display them in a user friendly way.
It's supposed to track which books I own physically, which books I have read, which I want to read.
Naturally, any book not owned physically is wanted to be owned physically.
